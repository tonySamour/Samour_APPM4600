# Create array of x values from 1.920 to 2.080 with step 0.001
x = np.arange(1.920, 2.080, step=0.001)

# i.) p(x) = (x-2)**9 expanded
p1 = x**9 - 18*(x**8) + 144*(x**7) - 672*(x**6) + 2016*(x**5) - 4032*(x**4) + 5376*(x**3) - 4608*(x**2) + 2304*x - 512

# ii.) p(x) = (x-2)**9
p2 = (x-2)**9

# Plot both versions
plt.plot (x, p1)
plt.plot (x, p2)
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('p(x)')
plt.show()

# iii.) The first plot of the expanded form is very sharp and has a lot of jumps,
# whereas the second plot (in red) of the binomial is very smooth. This discrepancy
# is due to the machine doing each individual calculation of the x terms for the expansion
# as opposed to only using one x value for the binomial.
